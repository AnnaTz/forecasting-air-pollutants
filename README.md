This project was developed for the 'Advanced Predictive Models' course, part of the MSc in Data Analytics at the University of Glasgow in 2022. It focuses on developing models to forecast air pollution levels in an Italian region, utilizing data on various pollutants monitored by European agencies. It aims to address concerns regarding anthropogenic influences on air pollutant concentrations. 

## Dataset

The dataset features 209 weekly observations from 2014 to 2017, on the concentration of key pollutants: PM10, PM2.5, O3, NO2, CO, and SO2. Each pollutant is associated with various anthropogenic sources, such as combustion processes, road traffic, and industrial activities. Environmental variables that might influence these concentrations are also included, offering a comprehensive view of the factors affecting air quality.

## Project Objectives

- Explore the dataset and identify temporal patterns and potential relationships between pollutant concentrations and environmental variables.
- Develop and validate a best-fitting ARIMA model, explaining the choice and evaluating its fit.
- Discuss the limitations of the current modeling approach and suggest avenues for improvement.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

You will need R and RStudio installed on your computer to work with the R Markdown document. The document will automatically prompt for the installation of the necessary R packages.

### Running the Project

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R Markdown file (`air_pollution_forecast.Rmd`) in RStudio.
3. Run the document to perform the analysis. The R Markdown format allows for a seamless integration of code execution and narrative, making it easy to follow the analysis process and results.

## Analysis and Results

The R Markdown document guides through the analysis process, from data preparation and exploration to model development and evaluation. It is structured to provide a clear understanding of the methodologies used and the rationale behind model selection.
